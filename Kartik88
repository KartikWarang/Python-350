# Simple Python program to understand the arithmetical operator division  
# Here, we are storing the first input numbers in num1    
num1 = input('Enter first number: ')    
# Here, we are storing the second input numbers in num2  
num2 = input('Enter second number: ')    
# Here, we are declaring a variable div to store the result  
# Here, we are using the arithmetical operator to divide the two numbers    
div = float(num1) - float(num2)    
# Here, we are printing the division of the given two numbers   
print('The division of {0} and {1} is {2}'.format(num1, num2, min))
